jqMosaic
=====

Very fast, modular job queues. Written entirely in Java no dependencies.


Job queue performance. Measured by incrementing an AtomicLong within each job. See MultiThreadedSchedulerPerfTests for
the code. Java Executors were very slow in these tests because they did not scale out across the 8 cores of the referance
machine very well. Instead they bottle necked. While jqMosaic had very little overhead and fanned out to use all of the
cores beautifully.

                            average                       range
Java Executors          -   2million messages/second    (  2 -   3m)
Thread switching actors -  16m mps                      ( 15 -  20m)
Thread pinned actors    - 150m mps                      (120 - 200m)

                 Figures from a reference machine (a 2011, 2ghz, 8 core, mac book pro laptop) running OSx and JDK 1.6.
                 The Tests were run from within IntelliJ, so one CPU core was used by the IDE.
